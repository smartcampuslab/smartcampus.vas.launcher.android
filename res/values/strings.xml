      The Trento Rise project "Smart Campus" ended officially on December 31st, 2014, but is still alive 
      in the results it produced and disseminated in Trentino. Besides having had important research impacts, 
      Smart Campus distributed over the territory a set of services that will not get lost but they will 
      remain available on the Google and Apple marketplaces.
 
      <p>The services that have been most successful among the campus students will continue to live, 
      hosted by the Smart Community project: "iFame" - created and produced entirely by students to better 
      enjoy meals in the university canteens - and "ViaggiaTrento" - an app about sustainable mobility which 
      is already widely used outside the campus. Other services, such as "StudyMate", "Inbox" and "ViviTrento" 
      will follow shortly.</p>
 
      <p>The Smart Campus project team wants to thank all those who contributed to the success of the project: 
      first of all the real stars of the project, the students, who have contributed in various ways to 
      achieve the expected results; but also our partners throughout the territory: Municipality of Trento, 
      Consorzio dei Comuni, the Open Data Initiative of the Autonomous Province of Trento, ITT Marconi in 
      Rovereto, ITI Buonarroti in Trento, Opera Universitaria, Trentino Trasporti Esercizio; without 
      forgetting the institutes and associations that have allowed all this with their support: Trento Rise 
      Association, University of Trento and Fondazione Bruno Kessler.</p>
